    Compute the force traction proportional to the area of the element
    in any-direction.

    Parameters
    ----------
    f_mat : ndarray
        normal force vector of one element in matrix notation. The shape of
        `f_mat`  is (no_of_nodes, dofs_per_node)
        It weights the participations of the nodes to the defined force
        e.g. for line element: a half for each node times length of the element
    direction : ndarray
        normalized vector describing the direction, in which the force should
        act.

    Returns
    -------
    f : ndarray
        force vector of traction vector in voigt notation (1d-array)
