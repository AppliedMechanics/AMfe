Notes on the amfe finite element code


# Meshing:

## Indexing:
There is a conflict in different ecosystems, which indexing style is better:
starting a list with index 0 or with index 1. Both sides have different
advantages and shortcomings; The main issue is, that the workflow in amfe has canges in indexing incorporated. They show up when the indexing style changes. So there are following indexing-ecosystems:

Index starts with 0:
- Python list and array indexing, and so is the amfe-code
- paraview

Index stars with 1:
- gmsh node-, line-, and element-numbering

So the rule is, that the system works on indexing 0, and the import data from gmsh are changed. So should be done when importing ANSYS-files as well.
